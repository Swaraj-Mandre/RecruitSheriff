# RecruitSheriff – AI Resume Analyzer

RecruitSheriff is a full‑stack resume analysis tool that helps candidates and recruiters quickly evaluate how well a resume matches a given job description. It provides an ATS‑style match score and generates AI‑powered interview questions based on the resume and role.

## Features

- Resume upload with job description input (web UI).
- ATS‑like match score between resume and job description.
- AI‑generated interview questions tailored to the candidate’s profile.
- Privacy‑friendly: processing happens on your machine; no data is stored in a database.
- Built with a modern stack: Flutter for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Flutter (Web)
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Language Model API:** Groq (LLM API)
- **Other:** REST API communication between Flutter and Node.js

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed and configured for web.
- Node.js and npm installed (recent LTS or current version).
- A Groq API key (or your own LLM provider key) configured in the backend.

### 1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Swaraj-Mandre/RecruitSheriff.git
cd RecruitSheriff

### 2. Setup and run the backend

cd server
npm install
node index.js


The backend will start on port **8080** by default (configurable in `index.js`).

### 3. Run the Flutter web frontend

In a second terminal from the project root:

flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome


Flutter will build the web app and open it in Chrome on a `http://localhost:<port>` URL.

## Usage

1. Open the Flutter web app in your browser.
2. Upload your resume (PDF) and paste a job description.
3. Click **Analyze Resume**.
4. View:
   - The **match score** (0–100) estimating how well the resume fits the role.
   - A list of **AI‑generated interview questions** you can use for preparation or screening.

## Configuration

- Backend environment variables (example):
  - `GROQ_API_KEY` – API key for the Groq LLM service.
- Ports and other settings can be adjusted in `server/index.js`.

## Contributing

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome.

Typical workflow:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch:
                            git checkout -b feature/my-improvement
3. Commit your changes and push the branch.
4. Open a Pull Request to the `main` branch.

Please keep PRs focused and add a short description of the change and testing steps.

## Roadmap / Ideas

- More detailed ATS breakdown (skills, keywords, experience match).
- Support for multiple resumes comparison.
- Exportable reports (PDF/HTML).
- Basic auth or admin dashboard for multi‑user use.
